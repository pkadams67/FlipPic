# FlipPic Copyright Policy

*Last updated: January 1, 2024*

At FlipPic, we value and respect intellectual property rights and expect our users to do the same.

In compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA") and other relevant laws, FlipPic has implemented a policy to take action against users who are identified as repeat infringers at our discretion. Additionally, we may limit access to FlipPic's website and services ("Service") and terminate the accounts of users who infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of whether it involves repeat infringement. FlipPic promptly addresses claims of copyright infringement on its website through its designated Copyright Agent, as detailed below.

Please note that knowingly providing false information in your notification claiming infringement may result in liability for damages, including costs and attorney's fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer due to our reliance on such misrepresentation in removing or restricting access to the allegedly infringing material or activity.

If you are a copyright owner or an authorized representative of one, empowered to act under exclusive copyright rights, kindly report instances of alleged copyright infringement occurring on or through our Services using the provided DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement. Deliver this notice to FlipPic's designated Copyright Agent. Upon receiving the notice, as described below, FlipPic will take appropriate action at its sole discretion, including removing the contested material from our Services.
